# Stagger

Do you find yourself staggering when trying to use bloated static site generators when you just need to create a simple website and use maybe 10% of their "features"? If so, then Stagger might be for you.

Stagger is a minimalist static website generator.

It uses [Markdown](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/) for content, [YAML](https://yaml.org/) for configuration files and [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) for HTML templates. When using good external libraries for processing these languages, Stagger itself should be just a few hundred lines of clear code. This simplicity makes the tool easy to understand and customize to your own use case.
